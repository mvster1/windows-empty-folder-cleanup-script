# Safe Empty Directory Cleanup

A PowerShell script that safely identifies and removes empty directories from common Windows system locations. This tool helps maintain a clean system by removing leftover empty folders from uninstalled programs and temporary operations.

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- **Only removes completely empty directories** - no files or subdirectories present
- **Non-recursive scanning** - only checks direct child folders, not nested structures
- **Double verification** - confirms directory is still empty before deletion
- **Permission handling** - gracefully handles access denied scenarios
- **Preview mode** - see what would be deleted without making changes
- **Interactive confirmation** - prompts before deletion unless forced

## üìÇ Scanned Locations

The script scans the following system locations for empty directories:

### Program Files
- `Program Files`
- `Program Files (x86)`

### User Data (AppData)
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%` (AppData\Local)
- `%APPDATA%` (AppData\Roaming)
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\..\LocalLow` (AppData\LocalLow)

### System Temporary Folders
- `%TEMP%` (User temporary folder)
- `%TMP%` (Alternative temp folder)
- `%WINDIR%\Temp` (System temporary folder)
- `%PROGRAMDATA%` (Shared application data)

### User Folders
- `%USERPROFILE%\Downloads`
- `%USERPROFILE%\Desktop`
- `%USERPROFILE%\Documents`
- `%PUBLIC%` (Public user folder)

### Cache & Temporary Data
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache` (IE/Edge cache)
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Cache`
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles`
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages` (Microsoft Store apps)

### Additional System Locations
- `C:\Users\Public`
- `%ALLUSERSPROFILE%`

## üöÄ Usage

### Prerequisites
- Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell Core 7+
- Administrator privileges recommended (for system folders)

### Basic Usage

```powershell
# Preview mode - see what would be deleted (RECOMMENDED FIRST RUN)
.\script.ps1 -WhatIf

# Interactive mode with confirmation prompt
.\script.ps1

# Skip confirmation prompt
.\script.ps1 -Force
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `-WhatIf` | Switch | Preview mode - shows what would be deleted without making changes |
| `-Force` | Switch | Skip the confirmation prompt and proceed with deletion |

  Removed: C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\UnusedApp
  Removed: C:\Users\Username\Downloads\OldDownloads

Operation completed:
  Successfully removed: 4 directories
  Errors encountered: 1 directories
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### What Gets Deleted
- **ONLY** directories that are completely empty (no files, no subdirectories)
- Only direct child directories of scanned locations (not recursive)
- Directories are verified empty twice before deletion

### What Does NOT Get Deleted
- Directories with any files (including hidden files)
- Directories with subdirectories (even empty ones)
- Directories the script cannot access due to permissions
- System-critical directories (script only scans safe locations)

### Recommendations
1. **Always run with `-WhatIf` first** to preview changes
2. **Run as Administrator** for complete system access
3. **Close all applications** before running to avoid permission issues
4. **Review the list** of directories before confirming deletion
